Do you agree that limitation breeds creativity?

Sometimes, having “unlimited” of everything is not a good idea. It makes you feel “small” and overpowered.

Last time, education used to be expensive. But today, anyone who have access to the internet can learn anything from coding to playing the guitar. But how many are actually using said resources to do serious learning?

Today’s computers & personal devices have almost unlimited capabilities. The smartphone on your hand has more processing power than the computer NASA used to launch the first men to the moon.

But are you using it fully? Or all you do was just liking your friend’s holiday pictures on facebook & posting on instagram?

I remember when I had a nokia brick phone, I will try to look for all ways to make my phone do the things that are not supposed to do. For example, buying a data cable so that I can load new Java games into my phone that I found on some obscure website.

I also loaded a custom firmware into my first digicam Canon A720 IS so that I can play reversi on the screen by using the d-pad. (Yes it is possible: <a href="http://chdk.wikia.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://chdk.wikia.com</a>)

Today, we have full featured DSLR, powerful iPads, connected smartphone, we should be able to do much more. But it seems that is not the truth.

So sometimes, I like to have things the basic way. **I believe imposing limitation can actually makes you more creative.**

You don’t have to have everything to get started. You will never be ready, or be enough of resources. If you want to start or do something but realised you don’t have enough resources, my advice is to do it anyway and make do of what you already have.

Who knows what you might discover along the way due to limitations?
