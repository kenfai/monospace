Read an article today that talks about how you can never get rich by being an employee.

<a href="http://www.inc.com/jeff-haden/the-only-way-to-get-really-really-rich.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://www.inc.com/jeff-haden/the-only-way-to-get-really-really-rich.html</a>

Although I agree with the author wholeheartedly, but not everyone is fit for entrepreneurship, be it mentally or physically. I have noticed some of the people around me, the way they think, talk, & make decisions clearly show that they are not cut for it.

So just keep this in mind: if you want to be rich & yet are not willing to change, the chances of you getting rich is very close to 0%.
