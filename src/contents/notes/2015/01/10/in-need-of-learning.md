I find that when learning a skill or knowledge, it is more effective when you have immediate application for it.

If you are just learning something because everyone else is learning, or for your own “future-proof”, chances are you will not learn it well, and will face the risk of forgetting everything soon after you stop learning. You will also have a high chance of abandoning the learning progress due to boredom.

However, if you have an immediate need of a skill or knowledge, it is logical that you will be more alert & focus in your learning. Moreover, you will have the chance of applying the knowledge, further enforcing the skill in you.

So, don’t rush or be greedy to want to learn everything. Overwhelming yourself do more harm than good. The right time to learn something will come, and you will know it by then.
