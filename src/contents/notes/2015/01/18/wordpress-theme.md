I find myself searching for the “best” wordpress theme again today.

Everytime when I wanted to start a wordpress site project, the cycle repeats itself: install latest wordpress, look for latest best free theme, install plugin, setup accounts, etc.

At first I thought the wordpress theme marketplace is saturated & may not be a good market to venture into. Then I realized people are actually looking for new theme all the time.

So I think this is still a viable business IF(a big if) you are capable of creating high quality themes. Of course, provided that wordpress is still a popular & growing platform. This also applies to other platform such as certain e-Commerce software.

Hope in future I can learn about design and able to create themes for wordpress as well. That way, I can have a theme to look exactly the way I want!
