In photography, the perfect shots are the one that contains imperfection within.

In life, perfection is an illusion. If there’s no imperfection, we won’t see perfection.

Comparison is human nature. We see the imperfect in ourself through the seemingly perfection of others.

In work, we feel our work is perfect when our competitors are imperfect.

Therefore, stop trying to attain perfection. There will never be one. Instead, embrace imperfection. Sometimes life needs to be a little imperfect so that we will appreciate the ‘perfect’ moments.
