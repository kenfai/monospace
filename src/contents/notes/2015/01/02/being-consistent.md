It’s New Year & some of us might start doing things that is supposed to improve ourselves. For example: going to the gym or learning a new language. However, how many can persist?

So what if you ran 10km today? Can you do it again tomorrow? Can you do it everyday for the whole year?

Start small but be consistent. It’s perfectly OK even if you just achieved +1% improvement from yesterday. If you do it everyday, you will improve over 300% by the end of the year!

The winners are those who can deliver consistently.
