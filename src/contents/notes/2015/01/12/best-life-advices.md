Stumbled upon a post on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2s1z1c/whats_the_best_advice_youve_ever_received/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reddit</a> asking about best life advice. Here are some good ones:

**“Learn something about everything, and everything about something”**

“The best time to plant a tree is twenty years ago, the second best time is right now.”

“Eye contact. Back straight and chin up.”

“Don’t look at what people say…look at what they do.”

“Good judgement comes from experience. Experience comes from bad judgement.”

“Be good or be good at it.”

“Buy a plunger before you need a plunger.”

“If you say no to one social arrangement you say no to 100 more that will come out of it.”

“We judge ourselves based on our thoughts. The world judges us based on our actions.”

“If you’re the smartest in the room you are in the wrong room.”

“You deserve what you accept”

“Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent”

Good luck!
