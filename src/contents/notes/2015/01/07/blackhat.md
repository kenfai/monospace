What do you get when you put Chris Hemsworth (Thor), Lee Hom (Asian heartthrob), & Computer Security together?

You get Blackhat. Yes, it is a very unlikely outcome.

It’s been a while since such movie about computer security(or hacking, for the common man) as the main plot has been made.

From the Featurette, it looks like the hacking elements in the movie will be as accurate as possible. I do hope those actors are as convincing too!

Such movie is good for the public. It educates the general public about the threat present in today’s connected world. People must know computer security is not only a concern for the corporations who provide the service. Anyone can be a victim as long as you are connected to the internet(ehem, your smartphone).

The threat is real. Be in control, or you will be controlled.
